The idea is to create an ensemble instrument.  We want to utilize visual objects, drawn and loaded, and link them with audio samples, triggering them in some way.  We will be basing this off of Akito's framework from interactive music.  Rules or rule sets will also be put into effect on the interaction to change how the group of 5 will interact with one another.  Currently, there is no restriction on the type of music that will be played other than the fact that it will largely be made up of samples.  It is the hope that by creating certain rulesets for interaction and employing visual objects as triggering tools/avatars that we can incorporate ideas of narrative in song making in a semi-improvisatory manner and create an instrument that can bring about group virtuosity.
